# fs-loan-qualification-checker

In this workshop, you will continue to learn how to work with conditionals by building a loan qualification checker app.

You will learn more about if statements, and how to use comparison operators and multiple conditions in an if statement.

Step 1
In this workshop, you'll review JavaScript conditionals by building a loan qualification checker app.

The app will check whether the user is eligible for a duplex, car, and condo loan based on their annual income and credit score. A credit score is a number that represents how good you are at managing borrowed money.

To get started, create the following variables and values.

Variable Name	Value
minIncomeForDuplex	60000
minCreditScoreForDuplex	700
minIncomeForCondo	45000
minCreditScoreForCondo	680
minIncomeForCar	30000
minCreditScoreForCar	650

Step 2
When the user is eligible for a loan, you'll want to display a message to them in the console.

For that, you'll build out a function inside which you'll have some checks that'll return what loan the applicant is eligible for.

Create an empty getLoanMessage function with an annualIncome and creditScore parameters.

Step 3
To check which loan a user is qualified for based on the annualIncome and creditScore, you have to use if/else if statement or a ternary right inside the getLoanMessage function. You'll then return the appropriate message in the block of each condition.

Starting with the duplex loan, check if annualIncome is greater than or equal to minIncomeForDuplex AND if creditScore is greater than or equal to minCreditScoreForDuplex.

If that condition is true, then the applicant is eligible for a duplex loan and the other loans. So, inside the check, return the string "You qualify for a duplex, condo, and car loan."

Step 4
If the applicant's annual income is greater than or equal to minIncomeForCondo, AND if their credit score is greater than or equal to minCreditScoreForCondo, then they qualify for a condo and car loan.

Check if that's true in the getLoanMessage function. If it is, return the string "You qualify for a condo and car loan."

Step 5
Now, you should check if the applicant is qualified for a car loan only. If they are, return the string "You qualify for a car loan.".

Step 6
If the applicant's annual income and credit score fall below minIncomeForCar and minCreditScoreForCar, then they don't qualify for any loan. So, return the string "You don't qualify for any loans."

Step 7
Now, it is time to test out your getLoanMessage function.

Use the table below to create 4 variables and their values:

Variable Name	Value
duplexLoanMsg	getLoanMessage(85000, 850)
condoLoanMsg	getLoanMessage(65000, 690)
carLoanMsg	getLoanMessage(45000, 660)
noLoanMsg	getLoanMessage(25000, 550)
After that, log each variable to the console to see the messages.

With that, your loan qualification checker project is complete!
